## Problem
Have two databases in mongo with collections but one has indexes and the other does not?

## Installing
- Clone this repo then run npm install to get dependencies.
```
npm install
```

## Running
- Once you have the dependencies use:
```
npm run copy
```
- Follow the instructions and this will make a file that stores the index information.
- Once you have completed that, run:
```
npm run apply
```
Follow the instructions, this is where you want these indexes to be applied.

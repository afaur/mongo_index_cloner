#Problem:

Have two databases with collections but one has indexes and the other does not.

#Solution:

Clone this repo then run npm install to get dependencies.
```
npm install
```
Once you have the dependencies use:
```
npm run copy
```
Follow the instructions and this will make a file that stores the index information.

Once you have completed that, run:
```
npm run apply
```
Follow the instructions, this is where you want these indexes to be applied.

...
Profit?
